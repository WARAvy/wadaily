<h1>The WADaily Project</h1>

WADaily is a student-led schedule viewing website created in 2021 by George Parks for use at Woodward Academy. This website primarily allows students to check the current schedule, along with a few other features. For instance, it displays updated weather information, a school calendar, and the lunch menu for the day. You can visit a hosted verison of the site at [wadaily.co](wadaily.co)
